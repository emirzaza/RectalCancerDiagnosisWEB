Rectal cancer poses a serious global health issue, and early diagnosis is crucial in managing this disease. Rectal cancer, a frequently encountered type of cancer in developed countries, is treatable when diagnosed at early stages. However, without timely diagnosis or accurate treatment planning, treatment options can become limited, adversely affecting patient outcomes. Therefore, early detection of rectal cancer and formulating accurate treatment plans are vital factors influencing patients' quality of life and survival rates.

In rectal cancer, staging the disease and characterizing lesions are pivotal in determining treatment strategies. Deep learning, coupled with the examination of Magnetic Resonance (MR) images, can more accurately identify cancerous lesions, forecast potential metastases, and thereby personalize and enhance treatment approaches. These techniques, in tandem with faster and more accurate diagnostics, allow for less invasive treatment methods, hastening the recovery process and optimizing the efficiency of healthcare resources.

Deep learning technology represents a significant revolution in the healthcare sector, particularly in medical imaging. In complex and diverse diseases like rectal cancer, deep learning techniques shed light on accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. These techniques can analyze large amounts of data to detect pathologies, determine the size and location of lesions, and even predict treatment responses.

This study aims to utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), a deep learning technique, for the classification and segmentation of rectal cancer images. The CNN algorithm is highly effective in classifying lesions critical for rectal cancer diagnosis and treatment planning. Classification involves categorizing lesions in MR images into specific categories such as cancerous or non-cancerous. Deep learning models can accomplish this classification with more precision and reliability compared to other classification methods. CNN's segmentation techniques allow for the detection of cancerous areas and precise mapping, providing detailed information for surgical planning and treatment. The use of these techniques will result in more successful identification and characterization of lesions, enabling doctors to make more precise diagnoses and treatment plans. This is aimed at increasing access to personalized treatment strategies for patients, thereby enhancing treatment success.
